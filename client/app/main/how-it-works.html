<p><strong>Step 1 : Adspace discovery</strong></p>
<p>Features a catalogue search so an advertiser can search for any publishers/sellers that are set up in the system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s search the Catalogue</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much interested in searching for publishers who target Marketing Professionals .I can apply that filter in the Marketing and business categories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much interested in working class so i apply a filter on the age groups of 25 to 45</p>
<p>I get a very specific and targeted list of publishers&nbsp; Journals ,Email Marketers, Magazines and Website &nbsp;that match/suit my search criteria/advertising objectives and possibly work with</p>
<p>Clicking in any one of the publishers brings me to their properties page which includes publisher&rsquo;s&nbsp; rate card and targeting features</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 : Compose Advert</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Advertiser :</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Select Adspace you are interested in and number of Insertions&nbsp; that you require</p>
<p>Selecting the Ad spaces that interests me from the publishers&rsquo;&nbsp; rate card &nbsp;brings you &nbsp;to the advert creation page .This page allows for the &nbsp;confirmation of advert details such as start and end date and creative &nbsp;upload</p>
<p>Having done that a request is automatically generated for the publisher</p>
<p>You can see the status of the campaign &nbsp;as PENDING indicating that we are waiting for response from the publisher/seller</p>
<p>In case you need any help with planning, please write to&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:help@adspaces.co.zw">help@adspaces.co.zw</a>.</strong>We will check the ad space availability and prevailing discount at the time of booking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Publisher</em></strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s transition over to the publisher&rsquo;s</p>
<p>What the publisher will see is that they have a new request along with the exact dates when it&rsquo;s required to be responded to. They also get system emails to remind of anything they might not have seen in the publishers UI</p>
<p>They also get notifications if anything requires their attention</p>
<p>What the seller can do is approve the request or edit the flight dates this would require the advertiser to acknowledge the new dates</p>
<p><em>Back to the&nbsp; advertiser</em></p>
<p>It looks like the publisher has responded in our favour .If iam satisfied I can go ahead and make the order .The system shows a preview of the order along with the terms and conditions associated with that order</p>
<p>The buyer can now submit the order and proceed to make payment.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 : Media Plan</strong></p>
<p>Now that both parties have fully committed the process moves to Media Plan<br /> Once the seller has approved the request &nbsp;and confirmed availability of the ad space we pop it from the PENDING page to SCHEDULED page</p>
<p>If creative had been submitted by the&nbsp; advertiser The &nbsp;publisher will be able to preview the creative&nbsp; and &nbsp;download it eliminating the need for manual creative submission &nbsp;.</p>
<p>As you can see Adspaces is a multi-purpose tool designed to automate the otherwise lengthy manual and error prone advert booking process into something efficient and can be done in a fraction of time as compared to the current process</p>
